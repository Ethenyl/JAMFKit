## Architecture ##

### Protocols ###

#### Identifiable ####

Represents all objects that can be received from / sent to the Jamf host. Its exposes two criticals elements:

- An failable initializer that takes a JSON payload and return the instantiated `Identifiable` object
- A function to return the JSON payload that represents the instance of the `Identifiable` object

### Classes ###

#### BaseObject ####

Represents the common denominator between most of the JSS objects which must contains at least an `identifier` and a `name` properties.

#### Building ####

Represents a physical building.

#### Computer ####

Represents a computer managed by Jamf, contains the general / location / purchasing information about the hardware.

#### Computer command ####

Represents a logical command that can be executed on any hardware element manageg by Jamf.

#### Computer group ####

Represents a group of computers managed by Jamf, contains grouping information.

#### Department ####

Represents a physical department.

#### Directory binding ####

Represents a logical binding between a computer and an active directory user.

#### Mobile device ####

Represents a mobile device managed by Jamf, contains the general information about the device.

#### Mobile device group ####

Represents a group of mobile devices managed by Jamf, contains grouping information.

#### Netboot server ####

Represents a physical netboot server, contains information about the server and it's configuration.

#### Network segment ####

Represents a physical network segment, contains information about the segment and it's configuration.

#### Package ####

Represents a logical application package, contains information about the application requirements and capabilities.

#### Partition ####

Represents a logical partition for an hard drive installed inside an hardware element managed by Jamf.

#### Policy ####

Reprents as logical policy that can be applied to any hardware element managed by Jamf.

#### Precise date ####

Represents a logical date within JSS api, contains 3 properties, the date itself, an epoch version of the date and an UTC version of the date.

#### Printer ####

Represents a physical printer, contains information about the printer and it's configuration.

#### Script ####

Represents a logical script that can be executed on one (or more) machine managed by Jamf.

#### Site ####

Represents a physical location (building, office, etc.).

#### SMTP server ####

Represents a physical SMTP server, contains information about the server and it's configuration.

#### User ####

Represents a Jamf user and contains the identification properties that are required to contact the actual user and identify the hardware devices assigned to him / her.
