## Architecture ##

### Protocols ###

#### Identifiable ####

Represents all objects that can be received from / sent to the Jamf host. Its exposes two criticals elements:

- An failable initializer that takes a JSON payload and return the instantiated `Identifiable` object
- A function to return the JSON payload that represents the instance of the `Identifiable` object

### Classes ###

#### BaseObject ####

Represents the common denominator between all the Jamf objects which must contains at least an `identifier` and a `name` properties.

#### Site ####

Represents a physical location (building, office, etc.).

#### User ####

Represents a Jamf user and contains the identification properties that are required to contact the actual user and identify the hardware assigned to him.
